      <p>Hey, my name is William (Willie) Bowman. I am currenty a Sophomore MA/CS double major at Rose-Hulman.
        I went to high school in the small town of West Alexandria, Ohio at Twin Valley South High School, and I am the
        first person
        from my high school to attend Rose-Hulman.
      </p>
      <p>
        I fell in love with mathematics, computer science, and learning in general my freshman year at Rose. Humans
        always seem to have
        pretty interesting theories about the things we can't see with our own eyes, take the dark side of the moon or
        under our beds for example.
        But mathematics and science in general gives us reason to make sense of the unknown instead of fear it. With
        research and collective learning,
        we are able to explain the unknown instead of accepting it as beyond ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is so much to learn in this world, I have given up on trying to learn it all. Instead, I desire to become
        one of
        the best in what I do. I believe I can bring value to any company with the critical thinking skills of a math
        major
        and the technical and computational skills that a computer science major may bring. If there is anything I have
        learned
        since I began at Rose, it is how to learn on my own. The wealth of knowledge that humanity pocesses as a whole
        far exceeds
        the knowledge of the smartest man on Earth, whoever that may be. It would be foolish to rely on one's own
        personal
        repository of knowledge. To me, it is most admirable to seek help in the face of uncertainty. So, I have learned
        to be
        resourceful in my time here at Rose, and I intend to implement that skill into all of my future projects and
        assignments.

        On a less serious note, I am a fun-loving nature enthusiast who loves animals and almost all sports. I grew up
        on a farm,
        so I certainly know what it means to put in a hard days work. I am not afraid to get my hands dirty, although I
        rarely do
        when I am completing a problems set or coding up a website as I am now. In high school, I was the captain of
        many sports teams
        including the basketball team, track and field team, and the golf team. I am also on the basketball team at
        Rose-Hulman, although
        I have not yet achieved captain status. Exercising, working hard, and seeing the positive results gives my life
        meaning
        whenever I forget what this life is all about.
      </p>

        Also, in case you were wondering, the picture to the right features my puppy, Nellie Sue. She is a spoiled pup,
        but
        my family and I don't mind since she is so darn cute.
